-> int,bool,double,string are primitive data-types, also has special support for these lists,maps,sets,runes,symbols etc.
-> Object: The superclass of all Dart classes except Null.
-> Null safety - by default Dart assumes that ur variables are never null, ? use this symbol with variable declaration to incoperate a null value in a variable.
-> ??- Called also null operator. This operator returns expression on its left, except if it is null, and if so, it returns right expression
